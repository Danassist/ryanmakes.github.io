# Logs

Keeping logs is a project of a sort, and keeping them publicly is perilous.
I am hoping the risk is worth the reward, and publishing these logs freely.

They may be useful, or boring, or opposite - these logs are going to be very raw.

Hopefully I can develop an edited style. Let's just get a publishing habit going to start for now :)
