It's day one again!

Transplanted from chapter1.md, now deleted:

# Chapter 1

This will be chapter one for now, as we plan the structure of this book.

We know we're going to have ryanmakes.ca/benny for the Molto Benny Boys, and similar for each project, and likely /log for the dated log entries that will point to the projects worked on.

"


Now we're in the dated log file, which feels right.

Our big goal is to get the Benny page hosted at ryanmakes.ca/Benny

That is our victory condition today.

# Benny page hosted at ryanmakes.ca/Benny

To make this work, we'll need the following:

 - [ ] git forge build server
 - [ ] static hosted
 - [ ] DNS updated
 - [ ] ryanmmakes.ca/benny working right on phone
 - [ ] QR code send to printer for gallery

(we're going to need to make entries for each of these in the [Glossary](/glossary/glossary.html) but that will come later)

We chose github as our forge for this adventure, because our truer choice was sr.ht but the owner has declared a fatwah on blockchain enjoyers, so we choose the popular thing, as a learning experience. It is, of course, horrifying - ads and jank front and center! How do people live like this?

We need to get this working Qube logged in to github.com/RyanMakes to work on github.com/RyanMakes/ryanmakes.github.io , and transplant these mdbook files into that repo.

----

Done, we are now typing in a local git repo.
We're using Pulsar Editor, which... has a built in GitHub integration. We generate our access token and log in our editor to the great beast Microsoft's service
Somehow that's not enough? We generate some keys `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ryan@ryanmakes.ca"` because that's what gh instructs.

After some wrangling, we got ssh git push working, so now it's time to enable mdbook builds for Pages with Actions (bleh, proprietary terminology using commons words. thoughtcriminals in the bad way.)

-----

http://ryanmakes.ca/logs/2024-06-15.html is up!! nice. Let's revisit the checklist:

- [X] git forge build server
- [X] static hosted
- [X] DNS updated
- [ ] ryanmmakes.ca/benny working right on phone
- [ ] QR code send to printer for gallery


Looking good! Let's get control of our URLs. We need /benny to work right.

We need to squash some DNS bugs early, about github pages hosting and www. subdomains. There's instructions, let's follow them, while we wait for our TLS/HTTPS cert to be generated.

Okay, https://ryanmakes.ca is looking good.
Now we need https://ryanmakes.ca/benny to work.
