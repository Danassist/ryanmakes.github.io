# Crown Thing

These are some pictures of our heads. This crown is gold, but it doesn't seem to have any effects on hair growth or density. This is unfortunate, because it would be great to have wonderful hair. Instead, you get to look at our split ends and scraggles. Enjoy this rare view of our foreheads in all of their glory!
